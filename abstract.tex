In this paper, we describe the work that enabled us to win the psychiatric symptom severity prediction challenge that constituted 
Track 2 of the 2016 Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) Shared Task in Clinical Natural Language Processing.  
The challenge was to correct predict the severity of psychiatric symptoms on a 4-point scale. Our winning submissions uses a novel stacked machine learning architecture in which (i) a base data ingestion/cleaning step was followed by the (ii) derivation of a base set of features defined using text analytics, after which 
(iii) association rule learning was used in a novel way to generate new features, followed by a (iv) feature selection step to eliminate irrelevant features, followed by a (v) classifier training algorithm in which a total of 22 classifiers including new classifier variants of AdaBoost and RandomForest were trained on seven different data views, and (vi) finally an ensemble learning step, on which
ensembles of best learners were used to improve on the accuracy of individual learners. All of this was tested via standard 10-fold cross validation on training data provided by the N-GRID challenge organizers after which the best three ensembles were selected for submission to N-GRID's blind testing, with the best of our submitted solutions garnering an overall final score of 0.863 according to the organizer's measure. 
All 3 of our submissions placed within the top 10 of all 65 submissions.
